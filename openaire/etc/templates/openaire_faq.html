<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute), and takes an incentives approach to encourage deposition under an open licence. Since there isn't a unique way of licensing openly, and no consensus on the practice of adding attribution restrictions, we accept data under a variety of licences in order to be inclusive. We will however take an active lead in signalling the extra benefits of the most open licences, in terms of visibility and credit, and offer additional services and upload quotas on such data to encourage using them. This follows naturally from the publications policy of the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE initiative</a> which has been supporting Open Access throughout, but since it aims to gather all European Commission/European Research Area research results, it allows submission of the material which is not yet Open Access.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What is the quota?</h5>
        <p>We are currently not enforcing any quotas on the maximum amount of files they can upload. This is likely to change in the future, but with quite high ceilings for open access content and data.</p>

        <h5>What happened to the OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository?</h5>
        <p>OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository got an extreme make-over and was re-branded as {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. If you happened to deposit your article in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository it is also available in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. You user account, was however not transferred to ZENODO, so you will have to <a href="{{url_for('youraccount.register')}}">register</a> again. If you register with the same email address in ZENODO as you used in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, you will still have access to your publications.

        <h5>Where does the name come from?</h5>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>How much storage you have available?</h5>
        <p>A lot. CERN currently stores more than 100PB of data from the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider</a>, and produces roughly 25PB per year. While ZENODO is not</p>
