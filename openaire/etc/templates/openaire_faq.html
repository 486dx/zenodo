<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute), and takes an incentives approach to encourage deposition under an open licence. Since there isn't a unique way of licensing openly, and no consensus on the practice of adding attribution restrictions, we accept data under a variety of licences in order to be inclusive. We will however take an active lead in signalling the extra benefits of the most open licences, in terms of visibility and credit, and offer additional services and upload quotas on such data to encourage using them. This follows naturally from the publications policy of the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE initiative</a> which has been supporting Open Access throughout, but since it aims to gather all European Commission/European Research Area research results, it allows submission of the material which is not yet Open Access.</p>

<ul>

    <li>
        <h5>What is the maximum file size I upload?</h5>
        <p>We currently accept files up to 1GB. If you would like to upload larger files, please <a href="{{url_for('invenio_openaire.contact')}}">contact us</a>, and we will do our best to help you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What is the quota?</h5>
        <p>We are currently not enforcing any quotas on the maximum amount of files they can upload. This is likely to change in the future, but with quite high ceilings for open access content and data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What can I upload?</h5>
        <p>All research outputs from all fields of science are welcome. We do check every piece of content being uploaded to ensure it is research related. Please see further information in our <a href="{{url_for('invenio_openaire.terms')}}">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="{{url_for('invenio_openaire.policies')}}">Policies</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Is data be safe with you?</h5>
        <p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Why is my upload not on the front-page?</h5>
        <p>All uploads go through a quick spam check by our staff prior to going on the front-page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Why is my closed access upload not on the front-page?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute), and takes an incentives approach to encourage deposition under an open licence. We therefore only display Open Access uploads on the front-page. Your Closed Access upload is still discoverable through search queries, its DOI and community collections where it is included.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What does it cost?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is free for education and informational use.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Really, who pays for this?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is developed by <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a> under the EU FP7 project <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIREplus</a> (grant agreement no. 283595).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What happened to the OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository?</h5>
        <p>OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository got a make-over and was re-branded as {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. If you happened to deposit your article in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository it is also available in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. You user account, was however not transferred to {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}, so you will have to <a href="{{url_for('youraccount.register')}}">register</a> again. If you register with the same email address in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} as you used in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, you will still have access to your publications. Don't hesitate to <a href="{{url_for('invenio_openaire.contact')}}">contact us</a> for further information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Where does the name come from?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus">Zenodotus</a>, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>How much storage do CERN have available?</h5>
        <p>A lot. CERN currently stores more than 100PB of physics data from the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>, and produces roughly 25PB per year when the LHC is running. {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is currently a drop in the ocean.</p>
