</p>
 
<ol>
<li>Zenodo is provided free of charge for educational and informational use.</li>
<li>The contents of Zenodo will be updated or otherwise modified on a regular basis.  Zenodo reserves the right to alter or delete information without notice.</li>
<li>All information is provided “as-is” and the user shall hold the Zenodo collaboration and information providers supplying data to Zenodo free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.</li>
<li>Users shall respect copyright and applicable license conditions. In particular, reconstructing the fulltexts of articles from snippets is not allowed. Download and use of information from Zenodo does not amount to a transfer of intellectual property.</li>
<li>Information obtained from the metadata of the Zenodo collection specified here may be freely reused under the CC0 license unless explicitly specified otherwise. With the exception of email addresses whose bulk download is not allowed all metadata of the other Zenodo collections are available under the CC0 license.</li>
<li>Any use of Zenodo that interferes with its regular operations or violates these terms of use or applicable laws may, at the sole discretion of the Zenodo collaboration, result in restriction or removal of user access.</li>
</ol>

<p> 
Please contact <a href="mailto:openaire-admin@cern.ch">openaire-support@cern.ch</a> if you have any questions or comments with respect to Zenodo; if you are unsure whether your intended use meets these terms; or, if you seek permission for use that does not fall within these terms.
