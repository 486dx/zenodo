<h4>Want your upload to appear in this collection?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Click the button to upload straight to this collection.</li>
    <li>The collection curator is notified, and will either accept or reject your upload (see collection curation policy above).</li>
    <li>If your upload is rejected by the curator, it will still be available on ZENODO, just not in this collection.</li>
</ul>
