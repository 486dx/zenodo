ZENODO is an open dependable home for the long-tail of science, enabling
researchers to share and preserve any research outputs in any size, any
format and from any science.

**Powered by Invenio**

ZENODO is a small layer on top of `Invenio <http://invenio-software.org>`_, a
​free software suite enabling you to run your own ​digital library or document
repository on the web.

.. note::
   ZENODO (R) and the ZENODO logo are trademarked by CERN and are not covered
   by the GPLv3 license. Thus, if you instantiate Zenodo on your own servers you
   must change the branding to your own.

   Please consider creating your own overlay to
   `Invenio <http://invenio-software.org>`_ and look to Zenodo for inspiration.
   We will be happy to help you get started, just contact us on info@zenodo.org.
